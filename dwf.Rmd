## What type of authoritarian regime is most common today?

```{r}

## Are Today's authoritarian regimes more durable than those of the past?

```{r}
gwf_all_autocracy %>%

  ggplot(aes(year, median_years)) +
  geom_line() +
  expand_limits(y = 0) + 
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1951, 2010))
  
```

## How authoritarian regimes fall?
