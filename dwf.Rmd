## What type of authoritarian regime is most common today?

```{r}
library(lubridate)

gwf_all %>% 
  filter(gwf_nonautocracy != "democracy") %>%
  filter(gwf_regimetype != "NA") %>% 
  mutate(gwf_regimetype = fct_recode(gwf_regimetype, military = "indirect military",

                                   party = "party-military-personal", 
                                   party = "party-personal", 
                                   party = "oligarchy")) %>% 
  group_by(year) %>%
  count(gwf_regimetype) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, n)) +
  geom_line(aes(linetype = gwf_regimetype)) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1950, 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000)) +
  labs(title = "Number of authoritarian regimes in power by type, 1946-2010", 
       x = "Year", 
       y = "Frequency") 
  
```
## Are Today's authoritarian regimes more durable than those of the past?

```{r}
gwf_all_autocracy %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarize(median_years = median(gwf_duration)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, median_years)) +
  geom_line() +
  expand_limits(y = 0) + 
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1951, 2010))
  
```

## How authoritarian regimes fall?

```{r}
gwf %>% 
  mutate(gwf_howend2 = recode(gwf_howend, `1` = "Rule change", 
                              `2` = "Election", 
                              `3` = "Election", 
                              `4` = "Uprising", 
                              `5` = "Coup", 
                              `6` = "Insurgency", 
                              `7` = "Foreign", 
                              `9` = "End of state")) %>%
  filter(!is.na(gwf_howend2)) %>%
  group_by(gwf_endyr) %>% 
  count(gwf_howend2) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  group_by(gwf_howend2) %>% 
  mutate(prop = n / sum(n))
